# GeoMeteorites

The aim of this project is to visualize meteorites hitting the surface of the Earth. The data were taken from

* Kaggle for the meteorites date, type (composition), geo position

* Open Street Map for the country location based on the geo position

* the [International Comet Quarterly](http://www.icq.eps.harvard.edu/meteorites.html) for the informations related to the effect on the ground.

This project was developped for first edition of the course `Data Visualization` taught at the epfl.

# Known bugs

* Pressing Start/Pause button, then changing the time range is not taken into account.

* Nothing under `mass distribution` tab. Is it normal?

* It is impossible to reset the parameters. How to go back after selecting a country? How to get a bigger view on the map?

* Add background with a fraction of opacity for statistics on the left.
