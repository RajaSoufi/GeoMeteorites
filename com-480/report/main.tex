\begin{abstract}
A critical part of scientific discovery is the communication of research findings to peers or the general public. Mastery of the process of scientific communication improves the visibility and impact of research. While this guide is a necessary tool for learning how to write in a manner suitable for publication at a scientific venue, it is by no means sufficient, on its own, to make its reader an accomplished writer. This guide should be a starting point for further development of writing skills.

\section{Introduction}

The goal of this project is to visualize the points of the fall in order to see the evolution of the dangerous places by centuries for example. The visualization have an interactive aspect to it, where the user can click on a location and see a meteorite fall in that location along with information about that meteorite. The users can enter the name of a country in a text field to see statistics related to meteorites for that country, or they can enter a year to visualize the meteorites that fell during that year around the world, again with statistics for that year.

We target a general public who has no knowledge in the field.

\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}

The data come from the NASA’s Open Data Portal and have been downloaded from Kaggle’s platform. The data were collected by The Meteoritical Society and contain information on all of the known meteorite landings. The dataset includes the following fields:

\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{name}] \ \\
  The name of the meteorite (typically a location, often modified with a number, year, composition, etc).
\item[\texttt{id}] \ \\
  The unique identifier for the meteorite.
\item[\texttt{nametype}] \ \\
  One of: -- \texttt{valid}: a typical meteorite -- \texttt{relict}: a meteorite that has been highly degraded by weather on Earth.
\item[\texttt{recclass}] \ \\
  The class of the meteorite; one of a large number of classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.
\item[\texttt{mass}] \ \\
  The mass of the meteorite, in grams.
\item[\texttt{fall}] \ \\
   Whether the meteorite was seen falling, or was discovered after its impact; one of: -- Fell: the meteorite's fall was observed -- Found: the meteorite's fall was not observed.
\item[\texttt{year}] \ \\
  The year the meteorite fell, or the year it was found (depending on the value of fell).
\item[\texttt{reclat}] \ \\
  The latitude of the meteorite's landing.
\item[\texttt{reclong}] \ \\
  The longitude of the meteorite's landing.
\item[\texttt{GeoLocation}] \ \\
  The parentheses-enclose, comma-separated tuple that combines \texttt{reclat} and \texttt{reclong}.
\end{description}

Rows containing \texttt{NaN} values or presenting a year’s value smaller than $860$ and bigger than $2016$ (suggestion of the Kaggle’s description of the data) will not be considered in our visualization project. In addition, some of the entries having coordinates values equal to $0$ ---referring to meteorites found in Antarctica of which coordinates were not given--- will not be considered.

After the cleaning, we end up with a final number of $31,705$ over $45,716$ entries.

\section{Tools}
\label{sec:tools}

The visualization is displayed in a browser for usability reasons: users do not need to download anything. This forces the application to be split into a front-end and back-end.

\subsection{Front-end}

The dynamic suggestion appearing when typing a country is done with Bootstrap which is stored in a CDN.

Jquery is used to easily switch tabs in the statistics window.

% TODO: topojson & three

\subsection{Back-end}

To do.

\section{Evolution of visualization}

Use examples and illustrations to clarify ideas and results. Figure~\ref{fig:denoise-wavelet}, we can see the two different situations where Fourier and wavelet basis perform well.
